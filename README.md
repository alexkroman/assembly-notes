# Assembly Notes

An Electron desktop application for real-time transcription and meeting note-taking. Records both microphone input and system audio (Zoom calls, music, etc.), transcribes in real-time using AssemblyAI, and posts AI-generated summaries to Slack channels.

## Features

- **Real-time Transcription**: Dual AssemblyAI streams process microphone and system audio independently
- **Echo Cancellation**: Prevents feedback loops between microphone and system audio
- **AI Summarization**: Uses Claude (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514) via AssemblyAI Lemur
- **Slack Integration**: Automated posting to configured Slack channels
- **Cross-platform**: Built with Electron 37.2.4 for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking with ES2022/ESNext modules
- **SQLite Storage**: High-performance database for settings and transcription history

## Configuration

1. **AssemblyAI API Key**: Required for real-time transcription services
2. **Slack Integration**: Set up a Slack app to enable automated posting (see setup guide below)
3. **Custom Summary Prompts**: Customize AI-generated meeting summaries
4. **Audio Processing**: Configure keep-alive settings and echo cancellation

Settings are persisted using SQLite database in your system's user data directory and persist between app sessions.

## Slack Integration Setup

Assembly Notes can automatically post AI-generated meeting summaries to your Slack workspace. Follow these steps to set up the integration:

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. **Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)** and sign in to your workspace
2. **Click "Create New App"** and select **"From an app manifest"**
3. **Choose your workspace** where you want to install Assembly Notes
4. **Copy and paste** the contents of [`slack-app-manifest.json`](./slack-app-manifest.json) from this repository
5. **Click "Next"**, review the configuration, and **click "Create"**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth & Permissions

After creating the app:

1. **Go to "OAuth & Permissions"** in the left sidebar
2. **Verify the Bot Token Scopes** include:
   - `channels:read` - View basic information about public channels
   - `groups:read` - View basic information about private channels (when invited)
   - `im:read` - View direct message channels
   - `im:write` - Send direct messages to users
   - `mpim:read` - View group direct message channels
   - `mpim:write` - Send messages to group direct messages
   - `chat:write` - Send messages as @assembly-notes
   - `chat:write.public` - Send messages to channels the app hasn't been added to
   - `users:read` - View basic user information (for DM functionality)
3. **Note the Redirect URL**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/slack/callback` (already configured in the manifest)

### Step 3: Install the App to Your Workspace

1. **Go to "Install App"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Install to Workspace"**
3. **Review the permissions** and click "Allow"
4. **Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token"** (starts with `xoxb-`) - you'll need this for Assembly Notes

### Step 4: Connect Assembly Notes to Slack

1. **Open Assembly Notes** and go to **Settings**
2. **In the Slack Integration section**, click **"Connect to Slack"**
3. **This will open a browser window** to authorize the connection
4. **Grant permissions** and you'll see a success page
5. **Close the browser window** and return to Assembly Notes
6. **Select your preferred channels** where meeting summaries should be posted

> **Technical Note**: Assembly Notes creates a temporary local server (`localhost:3000`) to securely handle the OAuth callback. This is automatically managed and requires no additional setup.

### Step 5: Using Private Channels & Direct Messages (Optional)

**For Private Channels:**

1. **Invite the bot** to your private channel: `/invite @assembly-notes`
2. **Refresh channels** in Assembly Notes settings to see the private channel
3. **Select the private channel** as your preferred posting destination

**For Direct Messages:**

1. **The bot can send DMs** to any user in your workspace automatically
2. **Select a user** as your posting destination to receive private meeting summaries
3. **Meeting summaries** will be sent directly to that user's DMs

> **Note**: Assembly Notes can send meeting summaries directly to any user's DMs without prior conversation. This is perfect for sending personalized meeting notes or confidential summaries.

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. **Start a recording** in Assembly Notes
2. **Say something** to generate a transcript
3. **Stop the recording** and click "Generate Summary"
4. **The AI-generated summary** will automatically post to your selected Slack channel (public or private)

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Make sure you're using the same workspace where you created the Slack app
- **Permission Errors**: Verify the bot has been added to the channels you want to post to, or use the `chat:write.public` scope
- **Private Channels Not Visible**: Make sure you've invited the bot (`/invite @assembly-notes`) and refreshed channels in Assembly Notes
- **DMs Not Working**: Ensure the bot has `im:write` permission to send direct messages
- **Missing Messages**: Check that the bot token is correctly configured in Assembly Notes settings
- **Private Channel Access Denied**: Ensure the bot has `groups:read` permission and has been invited to the specific private channel
- **User DM Access Issues**: Verify the bot has `users:read` permission to look up user information

### Security Notes

- **OAuth Flow**: Assembly Notes uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- **Token Storage**: Bot tokens are stored locally and encrypted in your system's user data directory
- **No Data Sharing**: Transcripts and summaries are only sent to your designated Slack channels
- **Open Source**: The entire OAuth implementation is open source and can be audited

For more technical details about the Slack integration, see the [SlackOAuthService](./src/main/services/slackOAuthService.ts) implementation.

## Environment Variables & Build Configuration

### Local Development

For local development with Slack integration, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy the sample file
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Slack credentials:

```env
# Slack Integration (required for OAuth functionality)
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_slack_client_id_here
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_slack_client_secret_here

# Development options
DEV_MODE=true
NODE_ENV=development
```

Get your Slack credentials from:

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Select your app
3. Go to "Basic Information"
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### GitHub Actions & CI/CD

**For maintainers and forks**: To enable Slack integration in GitHub Actions builds, you need to set up repository secrets:

#### Required Repository Secrets

Go to your repository **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions** and add:

| Secret Name           | Description             | How to Get                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`     | Slack app Client ID     | From your Slack app's "Basic Information" page |
| `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` | Slack app Client Secret | From your Slack app's "Basic Information" page |

#### Optional Repository Secrets (for macOS notarization)

| Secret Name                   | Description                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `APPLE_ID`                    | Apple Developer account email              |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization     |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`               | 10-character Team ID from Apple Developer  |
| `CSC_LINK`                    | Base64-encoded .p12 certificate (optional) |
| `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`            | Certificate password (optional)            |

#### Why These Secrets Are Needed

- **Without Slack secrets**: Builds will succeed but Slack integration will be disabled (shows "not configured" message)
- **With Slack secrets**: Builds include full Slack OAuth functionality for end users
- **Production releases**: Should always include Slack secrets for complete functionality

#### Setting Up Secrets for Forks

If you fork this repository and want to maintain Slack integration:

1. **Create your own Slack app** following the setup guide above
2. **Add the secrets** to your forked repository
3. **GitHub Actions will automatically** use these secrets during builds
4. **Your builds will have** working Slack integration

#### Security Notes

- Repository secrets are **encrypted** and only accessible to GitHub Actions
- Secrets are **not exposed** in build logs or to pull requests from forks
- Each fork needs **its own Slack app** and secrets for security isolation
- The app uses **OAuth 2.0 flow** with localhost callback for secure authentication

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
